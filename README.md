 Exercise 1:
 Given the following source code ML_L2Ex1_S25_sample.py, split the data set into training and
 test, test_size=0.2, and apply KNN with K=3. Compute the accuracy of your model and print the
 visual confusion matrix. Finally, print the first 5 images from your test dataset along with their
 actual and predicted labels.

 Exercise 2:
 Given the following dataset with two features: data = np.array([[1, 5], [3, 2], [8, 4], [7, 14]]),
 perform standardization using your own functions (even for mean and standard deviation).
 Furthermore, revert the standardization and print the values. Compare your results with the
 built-in functions for standardization and inverse standardization.
